## Overview
This web app is a developer's best friend. It allows a developer to randomly generate fake users or lorem ipsum text for use when mocking up a website or app. The ipsum text is filled with names of Apple trademarks.

## Libraries Used
In addition to the Debugbar, which was shown in class, I used the barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper package. This package was helpful in setting up my development environment; after installing and configuring it, PhpStorm was able to autocomplete code and recognize my Laravel directory stucture quite nicely.

## Sources
I used:
* Bootstrap for the CSS.
* <a href="https://pinegrow.com">Pinegrow</a> for the homepage template. 
* Images sourced from either <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">Pexels</a>, which hosts free stock photos, or from Google Image Search. 
* Random names generated by <a href="http://listofrandomnames.com">listofrandomnames.com</a> and stored as text.
* Apple trademarks, shown with proper trademark symbols. All Apple trademarks are the property of Apple, Inc.
